```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

set.seed(1)
```

## Get started

write some functions

```{r}
x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 4, sd = 2.3)
x_again = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 6, sd = .3)
y = rnorm(n = 25, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
(x_again - mean(x_again)) / sd(x_again)
```

Now a function

```{r}
z_score = function(x) {
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(x) == 1) {
    stop("Z scores cannot be computed for length 1 vectors")
  }
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  z
}
```

Try out the function

```{rerror=FALSE}
z_score(x = y)
z_score(x_again)

z_score(x = 3)
z_score("my name is jeff")
z_score(sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 25, replace = TRUE))
z_score(c(T, T, F, F))

z_score(x = iris)
```

### Multiple outputs

```{r}
mean_and_sd = function(input_x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(input_x)) {
    stop("Argument x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(input_x) == 1) {
    stop("Cannot be computed for length 1 vectors")
  }
  
  mean_x = mean(input_x)
  sd_x = sd(input_x)

  tibble(
    mean = mean_x, 
    sd = sd_x
  )
}
```

test this function

```{r}
mean_and_sd(input_x =  y)
```
